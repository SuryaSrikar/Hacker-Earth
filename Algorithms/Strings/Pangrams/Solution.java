//Problem: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/pangrams
//Java 8
/*

Thought process:

We know we only need to see 1 of each letter
We could use something like a hashmap to store all frequencies and check if all are  > 0


We only need 1 of each so instead we can use a set and remove it once one is found
and if it is empty we have found them all and we are done
this prevents a lot of unneeded work if the first 26 are the alphabet
in a long string
