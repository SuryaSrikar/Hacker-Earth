//Problem: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/chocolate-feast
//Java 8

/*
We have n dollars
Chocolate cost c dollars
you can trade m wrappers for 1 chocolate

Example
m = 2
n = 4
c = 1


Buy 4 chocolates
trade 4 wrappers for 2 chocolates
trade 2 wrappers for 1 chocolate

Ate 7 chocolates 

Chocolates ate = 0

chocolatesValue = money / cost per chocolate

ate += CV

while(chocolate value > 0)
chocolatesValue = chocolatesValue / wrapperExchangeRate + modulus
are += CV

can we determine based on initial wrappers how many possibly candies can
be gotten taking into account future exchanges?

10 wrappers and 2 ER

10 5 3 2 0

3

10 4 2

11 5 3 0

So far I don't see a way so lets code a implementation and see what we can learn

runtime O(n/2) O(n)
