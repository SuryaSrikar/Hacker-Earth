## Data Structures MCQ 3

Of the following data structures, which has a Last in First Out ordering? In other words, the one that came in last will be the first to be popped.

[&nbsp;&nbsp;]&nbsp;&nbsp;Queue&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[X]&nbsp;&nbsp;Stack

[&nbsp;&nbsp;]&nbsp;&nbsp;Vector&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[&nbsp;&nbsp;]&nbsp;&nbsp;Array&nbsp;List

**Explanation**: Correct answer is **Stack**. It is a well-known abstract data type (ADT) in computer science for last-in-first-out behavior. You can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)). On the other hand Queue is an ADT which depicts first-in-first-out behavior. Vector and Array List both are a kind of arrays which can grow dynamically in size. Both vector and arrays support random seeking in constant amount of time (O(1)).
